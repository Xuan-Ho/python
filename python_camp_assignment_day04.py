"""
Significant parts of the code to make the program demonstrated on the previous page have been deleted.
(Please use whatever bands or musical acts you enjoy instead of Markâ€™s!)Correctly write the missing code so
that you have a working program in your console.Note that \n is a character entity the moves to the next line
within a string. Also note that the line bandRatings = {} creates an empty dictionary.Post a screenshot of you
with your working output (not the code) to the console.
